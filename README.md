# hello-world
this repository is for practicing the GitHub flow.
I'm new to this whole computer language stuff and it's a little intimidating, but I'm sure it comes easier with practice.

**What do I place in a README?!!**
    A README is often the first item a visitor will see when visiting your repository. 
    It will usually contain:
        <nl>
<li> README.md
<li> repository license, 
<li> citation file, 
<li> contribution guidelines, 
<li> code of conduct
</nl>

This communicates expectations for your project and helps you manage contributions. README files also typically include information on:
        • What the project does
        • Why the project is useful
        • How users can get started with the project
        • Where users can get help with your project
        • Who maintains and contributes to the project

You can add  extra README files to a repository to communicate important information about your project. 
For more information about providing guidelines for your project, see "Adding a code of conduct to your project" and "Setting up your project for healthy contributions", in GitHub Docs.
